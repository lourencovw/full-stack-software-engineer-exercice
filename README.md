# Task Manager - Technical Assessment

A simple Task Manager application built with Next.js, Apollo GraphQL, KnexJS, and PostgreSQL.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
- NodeJS
- Npm (or other NodeJS package manager)

### Running the Application

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up 
```

3. Create the database tables
```bash
npm run migrate
```

4. Seed your database with initial data
```bash
npm run seed
```

5. Start backend service 
```bash
> cd backend
> npm run dev
```

6. Start frontend service 
```bash
> cd frontend
> npm run dev
```

7. Open your browser:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - GraphQL Playground: http://localhost:4000/graphql

│   ├── next.config.js  # Next.js configuration
│   └── tsconfig.json   # TypeScript configuration
└── docker-compose.yml
```

## Your Tasks

### 1. Find and Fix Bugs

The application has several bugs in both the backend and frontend. Your task is to:

- Identify the bugs
- Fix them
- Explain why they were bugs

### 2. Make Improvements

After fixing the bugs, make at least **two improvements** from the following:

- Remove inefficient queries (N+1 problems)
- Add validation and error handling
- Fix database insert return values
- Proper async/await handling
- Frontend re-render optimization
- Optimistic UI updates or proper refetching

### 3. Explain Trade-offs

As you work, explain your thought process:

- What are you prioritizing and why?
- What trade-offs are you making?
- How would you approach this differently in a production environment?

## Expected Deliverables

1. Working code with bugs fixed
2. At least 2 meaningful improvements
3. Clear explanation of changes made

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Apollo Server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with KnexJS
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose

Good luck!
